We will make an 2 diferent scenes.
- Relaxing part: Travelling and looking freely through a peaceful and relaxing enviroment.(With sound and some voice.)
- Task: Cognitively demanding task. It should be spatial working memory. (With different short and loud sounds: Acoustic_Startles and maybe gunshots).

We will start at Relaxing part for some time T and we will start the task for X time and return to scene.
Task scene class.
Relaxing and Tasks will be different scenes that will load each other on finish.
Input file with all the times of changing to the other scene:
Format:
	Relax:time;
	Task:time;
	.....

Save all those times to a "times" vector.
Each time we change scene we advance one in our vector.
When all the values have been read, we load a black screen.

Another exe file containing a program that will open a socket and collect the information sent by the socket in unity.
Types of messages you can show:
- Task/Relax + Started/Finished
- Own task's messages.
